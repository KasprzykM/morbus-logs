# DEPRECATED
No longer supported and maintained. As it does require active Firebase DB the original app will no longer work. 

# Morbus Logs
Morbus was designed as a fun offsite students project to learn Android programming while also making app that is somewhat useable. 
Its goal was to provide patients with ability to log progress of their disease in more structured manner: consisting of log entires, that can contain multiple symptoms each.
Each symptom entry would store more details about said symptom as well as picture (should one be needed, for example rash / or broken leg).

# Technology
* Firebase SDK
  - Cloud Storage - database that handled storing pictures by users.
  - Cloud Database - seperate database that handled all user info along along with history of their logs.
  - Firebase Authentication - Google account was required to log in.
* Java (7 or higher)
* Android 5.0.
